# Auto Insurance Data Cleaning Project

## Description
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing an auto insurance dataset spanning from 2009 to 2016. The goal is to ensure data consistency, accuracy, and usability for subsequent analysis and reporting. The project uses SQL for data cleaning operations, including removing duplicates, handling missing values, correcting data formats, and standardizing entries across various columns.

## Features
- **Duplicate Removal**: Identifies and removes duplicate records based on key identifiers like filing year, NAIC codes, and company names.
- **Data Standardization**: Standardizes column names, date formats, and categorical values for consistency.
- **Missing Data Handling**: Detects and addresses missing values through imputation, removal, or flagging.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies and manages outliers in numeric fields such as premiums written and upheld complaints.
- **Data Validation**: Performs validation checks to ensure data integrity, including NAIC code consistency and valid date ranges.
